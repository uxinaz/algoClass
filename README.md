Welcome to the exercises. This is where the magic happens! 

###Monday - June 13th
1. Implement a stack data structure:
  - https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass/blob/master/data-structures/stack.js
  - Note: only do the first exercise after you implement the stack
2. Create a queue data structure:
  - https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass/blob/master/data-structures/queue.js
  - Note: no need to attempt the last exercise. Come back to it after we cover breadth-first search :)
3. Start off with some intro to recursion problems
  - https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass/blob/master/recursion/recursionIntro.js
4. If you want a challenge, attempt some popular recursion interview questions:
  - https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass/tree/master/recursion
  - Note: some of these will only click after we go through sorting, graphs & trees later this week.

###Tuesday - June 14th
1. Implement the elementary sorting algorithms (bubble, insertion, selection):
  - https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass/tree/master/sorting-algorithms
2. Implement Mergesort
  - https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass/blob/master/sorting-algorithms/merge.js
3. Implement Quicksort
  - https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass/blob/master/sorting-algorithms/quick.js
4. [Bonus] Try out Heapsort
  - https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass/blob/master/sorting-algorithms/heap.js

###Wednesday - June 15th
1. Implement a Linked List:
  - https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass/blob/master/data-structures/linkedList.js
2. Create a tree data structure:
  - https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass/blob/master/data-structures/tree.js
  - Note: Hold off on Depth First Search and Breadth First Search because we haven't covered that yet.
3. This is a catch up day so use the rest of the afternoon to finish up exercises from previous days and review anything that was confusing.
